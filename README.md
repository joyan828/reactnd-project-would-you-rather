# reactnd-project-would-you-rather

This app is a game where you choose between two difficult trivia. You can check other people's preferences for the question after you vote, and you can leave comments to start the discussion. The more questions and answers you leave, the higher your ranking in the game. This project is for the second assessment for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

This app is written in React, Redux, Redux-thunk, React-redux and Material ui for styling.
